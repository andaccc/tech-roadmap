### Dynamic Programming ###

# DP
- Breaking down problems into simpler sub problems
- Storing sub problems solution
- Look up computed solution


# Stesps
1. Recognize DP problem
    - Problem solution can be expressed as a function of sub solutions?

2. Identify Problem Variables
    - list changing parameters (e.g. index)

3. Express recurrence relation
    - recursive

4. Identify Base cases
    - case cannot be simplified further

5. Iteratively vs Recursively
    - iterative: Full memorization table

6. Memorization 
    - Store function result in array table
    - Loop up before doing other computation

7. Determine time/space complexity
