# Design Principles 

## Composition over inheritance

## Encapsulate what varies

## SOLID
- Single Responsibility

- Open Closed
  - Open for extension
  - Close for modification 
- Liskov substitution
  - Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

- Interface Segregation
  - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use

- Dependecy Inversion
  - Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions

## DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)

## YAGNI(You Aren't Gonna Need It)
