##### Design Principles #####

[Composition over inheritance]

[Encapsulate what varies]

[SOLID]
- Single Responsibility

- Open Closed
  - Open for extension
  - Close for modification 
- Liskov substitution
  - Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

- Interface Segregation
  - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use

- Dependecy Inversion
  - Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions

[DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)]

[YAGNI(You Aren't Gonna Need It)]
