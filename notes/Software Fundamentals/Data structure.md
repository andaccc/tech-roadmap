# Data Structure #

## Array
- sequece of memory locations

## Linked Lists
- Collection of nodes which each node reference to the next node
- Stack FILO
- Queue FIFO
- Doubly Linked Lists

## Tree
- collection of nodes which connected by edges, root to leaves 
- Root node
- binary tree
  - each node has 2 children
- binary search tree
  - all left nodes <= root
  - all right nodes > root
- balance/ unbalance
- Complete: left to right order
- Full: both left/ right node

## Binary Heaps
- Min/Max
- complete binary tree
- parent >/< child
- insert O(logN)

## Tries
- prefix tree
- node store character
- * nodes/ null nodes
- form words
- to store languages for quick prefix lookups

## Graph
- collection of vertices and edges
- directed/ undirected

## Hash Table
- key, value with unique index
- hashing to generate index
- linked list
- faster look up, find the index instead look up the list one by one
- O(1)
- Worst case, high number of collision O(N)
